        <h1 class="title">Minimalism &mdash; My Interpretation and Manifesto</h1>
        <p>Minimalism in practice has existed for thousands of years, but only recently has it started to become known for what it is. The reason being that cultural norms have shifted<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> towards accumulation and acquisition, not necessarily in the sense of mementos but instead marketed ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to problems that may not exist, or in extreme cases harm the user under the guise of convenience.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The best example of this I can think of is the ‚Äúinternet of things‚Äù phenomenon. It‚Äôs widely considered normal now to have an internet connected refrigerator. More and more appliances are having non-trivial electronics embedded within them and being networked. And with this comes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/09/9-baby-monitors-wide-open-to-hacks-that-expose-users-most-private-moments/">a whole host of vulnerabilities</a> and the potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">data misuse</a> by the manufacturers.</p>
<h2 id="flat-design-and-the-breakthrough-of-minimalism-in-ui">Flat design and the breakthrough of minimalism in UI</h2>
<p>Prior to the advent of flat design, user interfaces were most commonly skeumorphic ‚Äî designed to reflect real-world analogs. This was largely skin deep, an e-reader application might make use of leather and paper textures to simulate the look-and-feel of a real book, or buttons might be rendered with gloss and shadow to imitate real-world objects.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-7-a-welcome-change/">things changed</a>. Interfaces started to strip things back to their basics. Strong colors replaced textures, inner shadows and highlights became a thing of the past. Drop shadow began to be a rarity - used only to communicate depth where necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2013/6/10/4416726/the-design-of-ios-7-simply-confusing">Of course, this shift was met with some criticism</a>. As brands started to reinvent themselves visually, there were many poor attempts and instances of companies <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11520930">making unnecessary changes</a> to follow the curve.</p>
<h2 id="minimalism-as-a-process-not-a-product">Minimalism as a process, not a product</h2>
<p>In recent years, minimalism has become something of an aesthetic trend, with companies producing products which conform to a stripped-bare aesthetic. However, it is insufficient to describe minimalist philosophy as solely a visual style. Instead, I interpret it as a system of evaluation which can (with minimal adjustment) be applied to just about anything ‚Äî programming<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, art or decor.</p>
<p>I define <em>my process</em> of minimalism as encapsulating evaluation of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is <code>$THING</code> actively used or will it see use in the future?</li>
<li>Does <code>$THING</code> bring me or those who I share my life with significant, unique happiness?</li>
<li>Is <code>$THING</code> maximally accessible?<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>Is <code>$THING</code> ethically produced?<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li>Does anything else provide the same functionality as <code>$THING</code> with fewer side effects?<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Above all else, I feel that minimalism is a deeply personal concept and something that can only be given meaningful definition to oneself after serious introspection and the recognition of a need to find <em>organization</em> and <em>clarity</em> in an area of one‚Äôs life.</p>
