      <p>Sometimes in life you have a blog and you accidentally delete the entire contents (one post, mind you). So this is my new blog.</p>
<p>In theory, I’m going to start writing here about whatever I feel like, what sparked this idea was that I have a lot of knowledge that isn’t trivially reobtainable, and I consider the internet an unreliable archive for things like niche algorithms.</p>
<p>My goal with this is to write things down for myself, often in ‘tutorial format’ should I need to relearn them. And if I can save other people time in learning those things by giving a more comprehensive resource, then that would be a great side effect.</p>
<p>I suppose it’s kind of like a New Year’s Resolution?</p>
